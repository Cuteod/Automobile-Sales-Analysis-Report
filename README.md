## Introduction

The automotive market requires more than looking at sales numbers. It involves examining how fuel types perform, how manufacturers position their models, and how consumers respond in terms of purchasing and resale behavior. I performed a comprehensive analysis of a used car sales dataset.

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of an automotive sales dataset, with a focus on **fuel types**, **manufacturer performance**, **pricing trends**, and **resale value dynamics**. The objective is to uncover patterns and insights that can inform decision-making for different stakeholders — including **manufacturers**, **dealers**, and **consumers**.

The dataset comprises detailed sales records including manufacturer names, model details, year of manufacture, fuel types, engine sizes, pricing, mileage, and resale value estimates.

The core objectives of this project are:

- Analyze how **different fuel types** (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid) contribute to overall revenue and value retention.
- Compare **manufacturer performance** across key metrics.
- Identify pricing and resale trends by engine size and fuel category.
- Provide **actionable recommendations** for automotive industry stakeholders.

## Key Questions Addressed

This analysis was structured around several important business questions:

1. How does **average price vary across fuel types**?
2. What is the relationship between **mileage and car price**?
3. Do newer cars always have **lower mileage**, or are there exceptions?
4. Which brands have the **strongest resale value** after accounting for age and usage?
5. How do **engine sizes** impact pricing across segments?

## Dataset Description

The primary dataset used in this analysis contains the following fields:

| Field Name            | Description                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Manufacturer         | Brand name of the car               |
| Model                | Model name                          |
| Year of Manufacture  | Year the car was made               |
| Fuel Type            | Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, etc.        |
| Engine Size          | Displacement size (litres)          |
| Mileage              | Total mileage recorded              |
| Price                | Sale price                          |
| Resale Value         | Estimated resale value              |

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using a combination of:

- **Pivot tables** to summarize data by fuel type and manufacturer.
- **Calculated metrics** such as average price, resale value, and engine size correlation.
- **Visualizations** (bar charts, scatter plots, comparative charts) to highlight trends.
- **Comparative analysis** to evaluate performance across manufacturers.

## Visualization and Analysis

### Fuel Type Insights

- **Petrol vehicles** produced the highest total revenue but displayed faster depreciation among mass-market brands.
- **Diesel vehicles** showed strong resale value in the luxury segment (e.g., Porsche, BMW).
- **Hybrid vehicles** offered a balanced value proposition with strong performance particularly from Toyota.

### Manufacturer Insights

| Manufacturer | Revenue | Resale Value | Notable Strength |
|--------------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Porsche      | $75.9M  | $128.1M      | Strongest resale value |
| BMW          | $121.3M | $107.3M      | High engine pricing |
| Toyota       | $180.0M | $63.2M       | Hybrid leadership |
| Ford         | $159.6M | $47.4M       | High sales volume |
| VW           | $154.5M | $45.9M       | Affordable range |

## Recommendations

### For Manufacturers

- **Luxury brands** should leverage their strong resale values and consider expanding hybrid/EV offerings.
- **Mass-market brands** should invest in certified resale programs to boost buyer confidence.

### For Dealers

- Highlight **hybrid options** for eco-conscious buyers.
- Promote **resale value benefits** for premium brands.
- Use trade-in incentives to support resale challenges for Ford and VW.

### For Consumers

- Choose **Toyota hybrids** for efficiency and balanced cost.
- Select **Porsche or BMW** for best long-term resale value.
- Opt for **Ford or VW** for short-term affordability with depreciation awareness.

## Conclusion

This analysis underscores the diverse dynamics within the automotive market — from fuel type performance to manufacturer branding and resale behavior. The findings offer strategic insights that can guide pricing decisions, fuel-type prioritization, and investment choices for all stakeholders in the automotive value chain.
